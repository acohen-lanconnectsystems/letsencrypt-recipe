 PART 7 - THE production script: issue + renew + deploy, unattended
=====================================================================
 RUN BY   : The 'ACME-Renewal' scheduled task (registered by script 04),
            daily, as the service account, elevated (RunLevel Highest):
              pwsh -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
                   -File "<scripts folder>\07-Renew-And-Deploy.ps1"
            Can also be run by hand for testing (elevated pwsh 7 as the
            service account).

 INVENTORY: the $CertHosts table lives in CertHosts.ps1 NEXT TO THIS
            SCRIPT (copy CertHosts.example.ps1 and edit). It is
            dot-sourced at startup; a missing file is a hard failure.

 WHAT IT DOES
   1. ISSUE  - refreshes every order's TRUE state from the CA
      (Get-PAOrder -List -Refresh, not the local cache), then acts on
      what it finds, via EasyDNSFix DNS-01. Sequential, with a pause
      between hosts (easyDNS allows 1 req/sec, 500/day).

        no order          -> place a new order and validate it
        pending           -> RESUME it: finish the DNS-01 challenges that
                             were never validated (logs which names are
                             still outstanding). NOT a fresh order - that
                             would discard in-flight work and burn a
                             new-order rate-limit slot.
        pending + expired -> the order's own window ran out; start fresh
        ready             -> validated but never finalized -> finalize
        processing        -> the CA is issuing -> resume and poll
        invalid           -> validation failed -> start a fresh order
        deactivated       -> start a fresh order
        valid + cert OK   -> skip; Submit-Renewal owns it
        valid + no cert   -> reissue (-Force; otherwise Posh-ACME only warns)
        valid + expired   -> reissue

      After every attempt it VERIFIES: a cert exists, is not already
      expired, and the order really reached 'valid'. An attempt that
      returns nothing is a failure, never a silent success. Once every
      host holds a good cert this whole stage is a no-op.

      ONE easyDNS credential pair (EasyDNS-Token / EasyDNS-Key in this
      profile's vault) is read once per run and used for every host -
      both zones are on the same easyDNS account. Posh-ACME also stores
      those args with each order, which is what Submit-Renewal uses, so
      renewals need no vault read at all.
   2. RENEW  - Set-PAServer LE_PROD, Submit-Renewal -AllOrders.
      (Posh-ACME only renews orders inside their ~60-day window, so
      most days this renews nothing and exits quickly.)
   3. DEPLOY - for every cert that was issued or ACTUALLY renewed, runs
      its Deploy hook from $CertHosts - for local IIS hosts that is:
        05-Import-CertToStore.ps1  (import + chain + remove superseded)
        06-Bind-IISCert.ps1        (rebind the site to the new thumbprint)
   4. REPORT - logs an inventory table (every host, NotAfter, days left,
      deploy state) on EVERY run, so a day where nothing renewed still
      proves the system ran and the fleet is healthy.

 LOGGING (see the LOGGING block further down for the details)
   Text log    C:\ProgramData\Posh-ACME-Renewal\renewal.log
               auto-rotated at 5 MB, 5 generations kept.
               Every run ends in exactly one grep-able line:
                 RESULT: OK   /   RESULT: FAILED
   Status file C:\ProgramData\Posh-ACME-Renewal\last-run.json
               machine-readable last-run summary + per-host expiry.
               Monitoring should alert on Result -ne 'OK' *and* on a
               StartedUtc older than ~36 h (task not running at all).
   Event log   Application / source 'ACME-Renewal'
               1000 = run OK, 1001 = run FAILED, 1002 = issued,
               1003 = renewed+deployed, 1004 = cert expiring soon.

 THE KINDS OF $CertHosts ENTRY
   Deploy = { ... }        automated end-to-end. Hook failure = FAILED.
   Deploy = { ... }  +  DeployNote = 'what is still manual'
                           the hook does PART of the job (e.g. mail: push
                           to the Exchange box's store, no binding). Runs
                           and must succeed, but logs a PARTIAL notice
                           every run so the remaining step stays visible.
   Deploy = $null    +  DeployPending = 'why'
                           cert is ISSUED AND RENEWED here, deploy is
                           still manual / a later runbook phase. Logged
                           as NOTICE, not a failure - deliberate, visible.
   (no entry at all)       a domain that renews with no $CertHosts entry
                           is logged WARNING + counted as FAILED, so a
                           silent gap still cannot hide.

 REMOTE STORE PUSHES (Push-CertToRemoteStore)
   An entry with PushTarget/PushSecrets gets its cert pushed into a
   REMOTE machine's cert store over WinRM, with the private key, and
   NOTHING is bound or restarted (e.g. an Exchange box, or an IIS host
   that is not the orchestrator).

   If the service account is a LOCAL user on this orchestrator it cannot
   authenticate to another machine as itself. Store a credential with
   local-admin rights on each target ONCE, as the service account:
     Set-Secret -Name <Host>-Cred -Secret (Get-Credential)
   Entries can list several secret names; they are tried in order, so a
   shared fallback (e.g. 'WinRM-Cred') needs storing only once:
     Set-Secret -Name WinRM-Cred -Secret (Get-Credential)

   Each target also needs WinRM reachable from here:
     Test-WSMan <target-fqdn>

   The PFX (which carries the private key) is copied to a temp folder on
   the remote box and deleted in a finally block, pass or fail. The push
   never passes -RemoveSuperseded: the target may still be bound to the
   previous cert, and removing it would break that service.

 DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED HOSTS
   Keep them in CertHosts.ps1 as COMMENTED-OUT entries with a one-line
   reason, so each omission reads as a decision, not an oversight.
   Typical reasons: the box is being retired; the platform issues its own
   certificate (two issuers for one name burn the Let's Encrypt
   duplicate-certificate limit).

 PROMOTING A PENDING HOST
   Prove its deploy by hand (runbook phase for that platform), then
   replace its DeployPending line with a Deploy scriptblock.

 WHEN SOMETHING BREAKS - SEND ONE FILE
   PS C:\> .\07-Renew-And-Deploy.ps1 -ExportDiagnostics
   Writes ONE text file (default C:\ProgramData\Posh-ACME-Renewal\
   acme-diagnostics-<stamp>.txt) holding: machine/user/elevation, script
   hashes, module + plugin state, ACME server + account, live order and
   authorization status, certificates, the local cert store, the
   scheduled task wiring, breaker state, last-run.json, and the tail of
   the renewal log. SECRETS ARE SCRUBBED - the live easyDNS token/key
   values, any stored WinRM password, Basic-auth headers and
   token/key/password-shaped strings are replaced with [REDACTED].
   It issues nothing, renews nothing, deploys nothing, and still works
   when the config is broken (each section degrades to a note).

 SELF-REPAIR - what it fixes ALONE, and what it will not
   FIXES (logged as 'REPAIRED:', never silent):
     - Mark-of-the-Web on scripts copied off a share
     - POSHACME_PLUGINS missing from a -NoProfile session
     - EasyDNSFix.ps1 missing or stale in the plugin folder (hash
       compared against the copy shipped beside this script)
     - orders left half-validated (resumed - see ISSUE above)
     - TRANSIENT issuance failures: one retry at a doubled DnsSleep
     - easyDNS 420 throttle: back off 120s, retry once
     - transient deploy/WinRM failures: one retry
   WILL NOT (needs a human, by design):
     - a missing or wrong credential - it cannot be invented, and
       retrying spends this hostname's failed-validation budget
     - swapped easyDNS token/key - a 420 on the first call is ambiguous
       between bad creds and throttling; guessing in a loop makes it
       worse. Run 02-Setup-Vault-Account.ps1, which verifies live.
     - a name genuinely absent from the easyDNS zone
     - anything requiring a binding decision (Exchange, IIS)

 CIRCUIT BREAKER - why a broken host goes quiet at the CA, not in alerts
   Consecutive per-host failures are tracked in host-health.json. After
   -BreakerThreshold (default 3) consecutive failed runs the script STOPS
   calling the CA for that host, because Let's Encrypt caps failed
   validations per hostname and repeating a deterministic failure every
   night can lock the name out. The host is STILL counted as FAILED, so
   alerting never goes quiet - only the wasted CA traffic stops. It is
   probed again every -BreakerRetryAfterHours (default 168) so a name
   fixed at the DNS end recovers on its own, and
   -ResetBreaker <fqdn> clears it immediately.

 TEST BY HAND
   PS C:\> .\07-Renew-And-Deploy.ps1                     # normal daily pass
   PS C:\> .\07-Renew-And-Deploy.ps1 -WhatIfIssue        # list what WOULD issue
   PS C:\> .\07-Renew-And-Deploy.ps1 -IssueOnly portal.example.com
           # issue exactly ONE host and nothing else - the safe way to do
           # the first production issuance of a new name onsite
   PS C:\> .\07-Renew-And-Deploy.ps1 -SkipIssue          # renew/deploy only
   PS C:\> .\07-Renew-And-Deploy.ps1 -ForceDeploy web01.example.com
           # re-runs the deploy hook for that domain WITHOUT renewing -
           # proves the import+bind path end-to-end any time

 FIRST-RUN TIMING
   N new names x (DnsSleep 120s + ACME work + 60s inter-host pause): six is
   roughly 20-30 minutes. The task's ExecutionTimeLimit is 2 hours, so it
   fits, but expect the first scheduled run to be long. Use
   -MaxIssuePerRun to spread it over several days if preferred.
