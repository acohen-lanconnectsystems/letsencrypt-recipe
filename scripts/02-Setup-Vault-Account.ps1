 PART 2 of 4 - Secret vault + easyDNS creds + Let's Encrypt account
=====================================================================
 RUN AS   : *** THE SERVICE ACCOUNT *** that will run the scheduled
            renewal task. NOT your own admin account.
            >>> The vault and ALL Posh-ACME state are PROFILE-SPECIFIC.
            >>> Whatever account runs this script is the account the
            >>> scheduled task in Part 4 MUST use. <<<
 RUN IN   : pwsh 7 (check: $PSVersionTable.PSVersion -> 7.x)
            If your console is Windows PowerShell 5.1, type: pwsh
 RUN ONCE : Yes per service account (idempotent; re-running lets you
            overwrite the stored secrets)

 WHAT IT DOES
   1. Registers the 'AcmeCerts' SecretStore vault
   2. Configures the vault for UNATTENDED use (no password prompt -
      required or the scheduled task hangs forever)
   3. Prompts you to paste the easyDNS production Token and Key,
      then LIVE-VERIFIES them against the API - including detecting
      and auto-correcting a swapped Token/Key (this happened for real:
      the pair was stored backwards and produced misleading 420s)
   4. Points Posh-ACME at Let's Encrypt STAGING and creates the account

 EASYDNS CREDENTIAL FACTS (learned the hard way)
   - Enter each string exactly as LABELED on the easyDNS
     "Production Details" page. Prefixes mean nothing - easyDNS
     builds the string from whatever NAME the person typed when
     generating the token, so 'api...', 'ABC...', 'u6a...' are all
     possible for either value.
   - The Key is displayed ONLY at creation. If it wasn't captured,
     REGENERATE and capture both. Regenerating INSTANTLY kills the
     previous pair - coordinate so nobody regenerates after you store.
   - Wrong/stale creds and rate limiting return the SAME error:
     HTTP 200 with a 420 "Enhance Your Calm" JSON body. This script's
     live verification is what tells those cases apart.
   - Rate limits: 1 request/second, 500/day, daily reset 12AM EST.
     Verification below costs 1-2 API calls.

 EXAMPLE
   PS C:\> pwsh
   PS C:\> cd "<this scripts folder>"
   PS C:\> .\02-Setup-Vault-Account.ps1 -VerifyZone example.com -ContactEmail certs@example.com
   Paste easyDNS TOKEN (as labeled on the portal page): ********
   Paste easyDNS KEY   (as labeled on the portal page): ********
   == Verifying credentials against the live API ==
     Stored order works - credentials verified.

 PARAMETERS
   -VerifyZone    a zone in this easyDNS account (used for the live
                  credential check - one read-only API call)
   -ContactEmail  Let's Encrypt account contact (prompted if omitted)
   -VaultName     SecretStore vault name (default 'AcmeCerts')

 NEXT STEP
   Run 03-Test-StagingCert.ps1 (same account, same pwsh) to prove
   DNS-01 works for every zone against LE staging.
