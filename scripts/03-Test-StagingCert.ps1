 PART 3 of 4 - Staging dry-run: issue a test cert for EVERY zone
=====================================================================
 RUN AS   : Same service account as Part 2, in pwsh 7
 RUN ONCE : Re-run freely; staging has no meaningful rate limits

 WHAT IT DOES
   Issues Let's Encrypt STAGING certs via easyDNS DNS-01 for one name
   in each zone you manage. Passing every zone = the Phase 1 gate in
   the runbook is closed and you may move to production for the pilot
   host.

 USES THE 'EasyDNSFix' PLUGIN - NOT the built-in 'EasyDNS' plugin.
   The built-in plugin is broken against easyDNS's current API (it
   treats easyDNS's HTTP-200-wrapped errors as "zone found" and writes
   the TXT into a nonexistent zone -> NXDOMAIN at validation).
   EasyDNSFix is installed by 01-Install-Prereqs.ps1.

 NOTES
   - Staging certs are UNTRUSTED by design (issuer says "(STAGING)").
     They prove the pipeline only. Never deploy them to a host.
   - easyDNS rate-limits hard (HTTP 420 "Enhance Your Calm").
     This script issues the two certs with a pause between them.
     If you hit 420, wait a few minutes and re-run.
   - If validation fails with a timeout, raise -DnsSleep (propagation).

 EXAMPLE
   PS C:\> .\03-Test-StagingCert.ps1 -Hosts 'web01.example.com','vpn1.example.net'
   PS C:\> .\03-Test-StagingCert.ps1 -Hosts 'test.example.com'
   PS C:\> .\03-Test-StagingCert.ps1 -Hosts 'web01.example.com' -DnsSleep 300   # slow DNS

 NEXT STEP
   Run 04-Register-RenewalTask.ps1 (elevated) to create the daily
   scheduled renewal task. Production issuance for the pilot host
   happens per runbook Phase 2 (Set-PAServer LE_PROD).
